# StockPricePredictor
Model created and trained using Tensorflow. The dataset used is Yahoo!'s stock price dataset. This is a very crude program that is Not accurate. Although the program is not very accurate, I do not consider this a failure. The main purpose of this project was to be an intro into Tensorflow and for me to learn the basics of Tensorflow. With this goal in mind, this project was a complete success!
